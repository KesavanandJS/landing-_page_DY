# Profile Images

## Adding Your Profile Picture

1. Add your profile picture as `profile-picture.jpg` in this folder
2. Recommended dimensions: 400x400px (square)
3. Supported formats: .jpg, .png, .webp
4. The image will be automatically cropped to a circle

## Alternative: Using CSS Avatar

If you don't have a profile picture, the CSS will automatically show a stylized avatar silhouette as fallback.

## File Structure
```
images/
├── profile-picture.jpg (your main profile photo)
├── profile-picture.png (alternative format)
└── README.md (this file)
```
